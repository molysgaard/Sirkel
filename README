Chord is a DHT

to use compile Chord.hs with ghc -threaded --make Chord.hs

afterwards run as many Chord instances you want on the network you have.
It only supports LAN or boxes directly connected to the internet yet.

to put data into the DHT write "put " precedded by the data and press enter.

example:
put abc123

The data will the be saved in the DHT.
All nodes can now "get" the data using the SHA-1 hash of the data.

following the example ower:
the SHA-1 hash of abc123 in decimal is: 73082682478848395176339340946812037781470107948

therefore the command:
get 73082682478848395176339340946812037781470107948

will get the value from the responsible node and print it, in this example "abc123".
